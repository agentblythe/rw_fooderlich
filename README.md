Chapter 3 Key Points
- Three main categories of widgets are: structure and navigation; displaying information; and, positioning widgets.
- There are two main visual design systems available in Flutter, Material and Cupertino. They help you build apps that look native on Android and iOS, respectively.
- Using the Material theme, you can build quite varied user interface elements to give your app a custom look and feel.
- It’s generally a good idea to establish a common theme object for your app, giving you a single source of truth for your app’s style.
- The Scaffold widget implements all your basic visual layout structure needs.
- The Container widget can be used to group other widgets together.
- The Stack widget layers child widgets on top of each other.
