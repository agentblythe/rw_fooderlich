## Chapter 7 - Routes & Navigation
- You can wrap another router in a containing widget.
- Navigator 1.0 is useful for quick and simple prototypes, presenting alerts and dialogs.
- Navigator 2.0 is useful when you need more control and organization when managing the navigation stack.
- In Navigator 2.0, the navigator widget holds a list of MaterialPage objects.
- Use a router widget to listen to navigation state changes and configure your navigator’s list of pages.
- Setting the router’s Back button dispatcher lets you listen to platform system events.

## Chapter 8 - Deep Links and Web URLs
- The app notifies RouteInformationProvider when there’s a new route.
- The provider passes the route information to RouteInformationParser to parse the URL string.
- The parser converts app state to and from a URL string.
- AppLink models the navigation state. It is a user-defined data type that encapsulates information about a URL string.
- In development mode, the Flutter web app does not persist data between app launches. The web app generated in release mode will work on the other browsers.
